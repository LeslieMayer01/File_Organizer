organize, and standardize folders of legal case files. It also produces
CSV and Excel reports for traceability and institutional archiving.

## Features

- Deletes empty folders and index files
- Cleans `desktop.ini` system files
- Formats folder names to a 23-digit identifier + suffix
- Creates structured folders like `C01Principal`, `C05MedidasCautelares`
- Groups files under `01PrimeraInstancia`, `02SegundaInstancia`, etc.
- Generates `.xlsm` electronic index files
- Detects folders with naming issues and produces reports

TODO:
- Improve reports of what have been done
- Refactor to scan the entire folder or do it directly to one path
- fix the filter because the folders can start with C0 or C1
---

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- pip
- Git
- Docker (for isolated execution)
- make

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
cd repo
```

### 2. Configure `.env`

```bash
cp .env-example .env
```

Define `FOLDER_TO_ORGANIZE`, simulation flags, and paths to resources.

### 3. Run environment checks and Docker image build

```bash
make check-all
make docker-build
```

---

## Usage

### ▶ Run specific step(s)

```bash
make docker-run ARGS="--steps 1"
```

You can combine multiple steps:

```bash
make docker-run ARGS="--steps 1 2 3"
```

Each step generates reports under:

```bash
reports/step_<n>/
```

---

## Docker Workflow

All scripts run inside a container using:

```bash
make docker-run ARGS="--steps 4"
```

The folder defined in `.env` as `FOLDER_TO_ORGANIZE` is mounted at `/data`
inside the container. All reports are mounted to `/app/reports`.

You can rebuild or clean the image:

```bash
make docker-build
make docker-clean
```

---

## Development

Run tests and validations locally:

```bash
make lint        # Ruff linter
make test        # Run all unit tests
make typecheck   # mypy static type check
make coverage    # Show test coverage
make format      # Auto-format with ruff
```

To run a step outside Docker:

```bash
make run-step-4
```

---

## Documentation

All scripts are documented in Markdown format in `docs/steps/`. The main
index is located at:

```text
docs/index.md
```

Each step has:

- Description and goal
- Folder structure before/after
- Sample reports
- How to run and simulate

You can validate docs with:

```bash
make docs-validate
```

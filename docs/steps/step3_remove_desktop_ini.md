# Step 3 - Remove desktop.ini Files

This script recursively scans all directories under
`config.FOLDER_TO_ORGANIZE` and deletes all `desktop.ini` files it
finds. These files are typically generated by Windows and are not needed
in the context of file organization.

It uses the variable `config.SIMULATE_STEP_3` to determine whether to
run in simulation or actual deletion mode and generates a report.

## How to Run

Use the Makefile command with the corresponding step:

```bash
make run ARGS="--steps 3"
```

---

## Behavior

- If `config.SIMULATE_STEP_3 = True`, the script logs files that would
  be deleted but does not remove them.
- If `config.SIMULATE_STEP_3 = False`, the files are deleted.

It only targets files exactly named `desktop.ini`.

---

## Output

A report is generated in:

```bash
./reports/step_3/desktop_ini_files_<timestamp>.csv
```

## Example Report

| TYPE      | PATH                                        |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| DELETED   | /base/folder/desktop.ini                    |
| SIMULATED | /base/other/desktop.ini                     |

---

## Summary

Removing `desktop.ini` files helps avoid clutter and improves consistency
when sharing or packaging folder structures. These system files are not
required for data processing and are safe to delete.

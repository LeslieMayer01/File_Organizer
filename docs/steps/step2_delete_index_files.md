# Step 2 - Delete Index Files

This script scans all folders under `config.FOLDER_TO_ORGANIZE` and
deletes any file that starts with `00IndiceElectronicoC0`. It supports
simulation mode using `config.SIMULATE_STEP_2` and generates a report
listing deleted or detected files.

## How to Run

Use the Makefile command with the corresponding step:

```bash
make run ARGS="--steps 2"
```

---

## Behavior

- If `config.SIMULATE_STEP_2 = True`, the script simulates the deletion
  and logs the affected files.
- If `config.SIMULATE_STEP_2 = False`, the script deletes the matching
  files.

Only files starting with `00IndiceElectronicoC0` are affected.

---

## Output

A report is generated in:

```bash
./reports/step_2/deleted_index_files_<timestamp>.csv
```
